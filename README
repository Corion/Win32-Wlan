NAME
    Win32::Wlan - Query wlan properties

SYNOPSIS
        require Win32::Wlan;
        my $wlan = Win32::Wlan->new;
        if ($wlan->available) {
            print "Connected to ", $wlan->connection->{profile_name},"\n";
            print "I see the following networks\n";
            for ($wlan->visible_networks) {
                printf "%s\t-%d dbm\n", $_->{name}, $_->{signal_quality};
            };

        } else {
            print "No Wlan detected (or switched off)\n";
        };

METHODS
  `Win32::Wlan->new( %args )'
        my $wlan = Win32::Wlan->new();

    Creates a new Win32::Wlan object.

    *   `available' - optional argument to force detection of general Wlan
        availability

    *   `handle' - optional argument to give an existing Wlan handle to the
        object

    *   `interface' - optional argument to give an existing guuid to the
        object

  `$wlan->handle'
    Returns the Windows API handle for the Wlan API.

  `$wlan->interface'
        print $wlan->interface->{name};

    Returns a hashref describing the interface. The keys are `guuid' for the
    guuid, `name' for the human-readable name and `status' for the status of
    the interface.

  `$wlan->available'
        $wlan->available
            or warn "Wlan API is not available";

    Returns whether the Wlan API is available. The Wlan API is available on
    Windows XP SP3 or higher.

  `$wlan->connected'
        $wlan->connected
            or warn "Wlan connection unavailable";

    Returns whether a Wlan connection is established. No connection is
    established when Wlan is switched off or no access point is in range.

  `$wlan->connection'
        if ($wlan->connected) {
            print "Connected to ";
            print $wlan->connection->{profile_name};
        };

    Returns information about the current connection in a hashref. The keys
    are

    *   `profile_name' - the name of the profile of the current connection

  `$wlan->visible_networks'
    Returns information about the currently visible networks as a list of
    hashrefs.

    *   `ssid' - the SSID of the network

    *   `signal_quality' - the signal quality ranging linearly from 0 to 100
        meaning -100 dbm to -50 dbm

SIMPLIFICATIONS
    This module only supports the first wireless connection. If your machine
    has more than one wireless connection, you will need to use
    Win32::Wlan::API directly.

    Currently, the module also has no way of determining whether Wlan gets
    switched on or off.
