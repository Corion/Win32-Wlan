Returns the Windows API handle for the Wlan API.

sub handle { $_[0]->{handle} };

=head2 C<< $wlan->interface >>

    print $wlan->interface->{name};

Returns a hashref describing the interface. The keys are
C<guuid> for the guuid, C<name> for the human-readable name and
C<status> for the status of the interface.

=cut

sub interface { $_[0]->{interface} };

=head2 C<< $wlan->available >>

    $wlan->available
        or warn "Wlan API is not available";

Returns whether the Wlan API is available. The Wlan API is available
on Windows XP SP3 or higher.

=cut

sub available { $_[0]->{available} };

=head2 C<< $wlan->connected >>

    $wlan->connected
        or warn "Wlan connection unavailable";

Returns whether a Wlan connection is established. No connection is established
when Wlan is switched off or no access point is in range.

Returns information about the current connection in a hashref. The keys
are

=over 4

=item *

C<profile_name> - the name of the profile of the current connection

=back

=head2 C<< $wlan->visible_networks >>

Returns information about the currently visible networks as a list of
hashrefs.

=over 4

=item *

C<ssid> - the SSID of the network

=item *

C<signal_quality> - the signal quality ranging linearly from 0 to 100
meaning -100 dbm to -50 dbm

=head1 SIMPLIFICATIONS

This module only supports the first wireless connection. If your machine
has more than one wireless connection, you will need to use
L<Win32::Wlan::API> directly.

Currently, the module also has no way of determining whether Wlan
gets switched on or off.
